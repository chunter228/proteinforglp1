  <h1>Why Protein Matters When You're on Ozempic or Wegovy</h1>
  <p>GLP‑1 receptor agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy work by slowing gastric emptying and reducing appetite. While effective for weight loss, they can cause unintended muscle loss. Researchers from UVA Health found that patients often lose fat‑free mass and see no improvement in aerobic capacity unless they prioritize strength training and adequate protein intake【174947726990039†L27-L110】.</p>
<p>Protein provides the amino acids your body needs to repair and build muscle tissue. Without enough, weight loss may come at the expense of muscle, leaving you weaker and impacting metabolism. Aim for at least 1‑1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily, and distribute it across meals and snacks.</p>
<p>Choosing nutrient‑dense sources like lean poultry, fish, beans, tofu and high‑quality shakes ensures you get vitamins and minerals along with protein. Products like Koia can be a convenient option when your appetite is low—you get 18‑20 grams of plant‑based protein in a small volume.</p>
