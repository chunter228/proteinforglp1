  <h1>Koia’s Role in Your GLP‑1 Nutrition Plan</h1>
  <p>When your appetite is low, nutrient‑dense liquids can be a lifesaver. Koia’s plant‑based shakes provide 18‑20 grams of protein in less than 12 ounces, making them ideal for GLP‑1 users who struggle to finish large meals. They’re dairy‑free, low in sugar and include fiber to support digestion.</p>
<p>Use Koia as a snack between meals or blend it with fruits and vegetables for a balanced smoothie. Pair it with a handful of nuts or a slice of toast for added healthy fats and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Remember that no product can replace whole foods entirely. Incorporate Koia into a varied diet rich in lean proteins, whole grains and colorful produce to ensure you get the micronutrients you need.</p>
