  <h1>GLP‑1 and Testosterone: What a New Study Reveals</h1>
  <p>There’s more to GLP‑1 therapy than meets the eye. At the Endocrine Society meeting, researchers presented data showing that men with obesity or type 2 diabetes who used semaglutide, dulaglutide or tirzepatide for 18 months saw an increase in normal testosterone levels from 53% to 77%【511927651958314†L158-L191】. The improvement correlated with the amount of weight lost.</p>
<p>Testosterone plays a crucial role in muscle mass, bone density and overall wellbeing. For men considering GLP‑1 drugs, these findings suggest potential metabolic benefits beyond weight loss. However, study authors caution that lifestyle interventions—especially strength training and nutrition—remain essential for optimizing hormone health.</p>
<p>If you’re using a GLP‑1 medication, talk to your healthcare provider about monitoring hormones and incorporating strength training and protein‑rich foods to support both weight management and hormonal balance.</p>
