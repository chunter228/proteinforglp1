  <h1>Stopping Your GLP‑1 Medication? Here's How to Maintain Your Progress</h1>
  <p>Many people wonder what happens when they stop GLP‑1 therapy. A meta‑analysis of 11 trials found that individuals regained weight within two months of discontinuing the medication【630782945904530†L34-L77】. The drugs mimic a hormone that reduces blood sugar and signals fullness; once absent, appetite and weight often rebound.</p>
<p>To minimize regain, plan ahead. Maintain your exercise routine and continue monitoring food intake. High‑protein diets can help preserve lean mass and keep you fuller for longer, making it easier to resist overeating.</p>
<p>Consider gradually tapering rather than quitting abruptly, and consult your healthcare provider for personalized guidance. Prioritizing protein—through foods like fish, beans and shakes—can make the transition smoother.</p>
