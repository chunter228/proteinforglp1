  <h1>Protein‑Packed Meal Plans for GLP‑1 Users</h1>
  <p>Putting theory into practice, here’s how a day of eating might look for someone on GLP‑1 therapy. Breakfast could be a veggie omelet or tofu scramble with whole‑grain toast. Lunch might feature grilled salmon over quinoa and roasted vegetables. A mid‑afternoon snack could be Greek yogurt or a Koia shake, and dinner could be a lentil curry with brown rice.</p>
<p>Aim for 20‑30 grams of protein per meal and 10‑15 grams per snack. Remember to include fiber‑rich carbs and healthy fats to aid satiety and vitamin absorption.</p>
<p>If you struggle with a reduced appetite, smoothies and soups can deliver nutrients in smaller volumes. Listen to your body and adjust portion sizes accordingly.</p>
