  <h1>Plant vs Animal Protein: Which Is Better on GLP‑1?</h1>
  <p>There’s ongoing debate about whether plant or animal protein is superior for weight management and muscle health. While animal proteins contain all essential amino acids, plant‑based proteins offer fiber and phytochemicals that support heart health. Research suggests that diets with a higher plant‑to‑animal protein ratio are linked to lower cardiovascular risk【595822928387425†L91-L147】.</p>
<p>For GLP‑1 users, digestibility and appetite often dictate choices. Plant proteins like beans, lentils and tofu may be easier to digest and provide additional fiber, which helps with satiety. Animal proteins such as poultry and fish deliver dense nutrition in smaller portions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, variety is key. Combining plant and animal sources ensures you get a full spectrum of amino acids and nutrients. Ready‑to‑drink blends like Koia offer plant‑based convenience for days when cooking isn’t appealing.</p>
