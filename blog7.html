  <h1>What to Eat After Your Injection: Snack Ideas</h1>
  <p>Some GLP‑1 users experience nausea or reduced appetite after injections. Choosing gentle, protein‑rich snacks can help you meet your nutritional needs without discomfort. Options include a slice of whole‑grain toast with nut butter, a small bowl of oats with berries, or a creamy plant‑based shake.</p>
<p>Experts advise against relying on sugar‑laden snacks or skipping meals entirely. Protein combined with complex carbohydrates stabilizes blood sugar and aids recovery.</p>
<p>Try prepping snacks ahead of time so you don’t reach for convenience foods. Koia’s smooth texture and moderate volume make it easy to sip slowly when you’re not feeling hungry.</p>
