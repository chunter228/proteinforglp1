  <h1>GLP‑1 and Exercise: Building Lean Muscle</h1>
  <p>Exercise is a cornerstone of successful GLP‑1 therapy. UVA Health researchers note that GLP‑1 drugs alone don’t improve cardiovascular fitness【174947726990039†L27-L110】. Incorporating resistance and aerobic training helps preserve muscle mass and maintain metabolism during weight loss.</p>
<p>Aim for a mix of activities—strength training two to three times per week, moderate cardio like brisk walking or cycling, and flexibility exercises such as yoga. Pair workouts with 20‑30 grams of protein to maximize muscle repair and growth.</p>
<p>Listen to your body; GLP‑1 medications can affect energy levels. Start slowly and build up intensity over time. Consider working with a trainer or physical therapist if you’re new to exercise.</p>
