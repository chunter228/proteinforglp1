  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>GLP1 Protein Authority exists to help people using GLP‑1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy stay healthy, strong and informed. GLP‑1 drugs reduce appetite and promote weight loss, but they can also lead to muscle loss and nutrient deficiencies. Our goal is to provide nutrition guidance, meal ideas and expert insights so you can maintain muscle mass and overall wellbeing while on treatment.</p>
